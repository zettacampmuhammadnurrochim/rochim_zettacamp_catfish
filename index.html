  line-height: 1;">S</span>uperman was born on the fictional planet Krypton and was named Kal-El. As a baby, his parents
                        sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural
                        cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville.
                        He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark
                        developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His
                        adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to
                        fight crime. To protect his personal life, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias
                        "Superman" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis,
                        where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include
                        his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and
                        editor-in-chief Perry White, and his enemies include Brainiac, General Zod, Darkseid, and his
                        archenemy Lex Luthor.

                        Superman is the archetype of the superhero: he wears an outlandish costume, uses a codename, and
                        fights evil with the aid of extraordinary abilities. Although there are earlier characters who
                        arguably fit this definition, it was Superman who popularized the superhero genre and
                        established its conventions. He was the best-selling superhero in American comic books up until
                        the 1980s.[2]
